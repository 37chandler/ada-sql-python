# SQL and Python

This repository explores the interoperability between
SQL and Python. 

One reason we've been using SQLite databases is because of 
how well they work with Python. In this exercise we'll create 
databases, build tables, fill them with data, and write queries. 
Before we get started, move one of the Wedge transaction files 
into the same folder. I've included one of mine so the code will 
run as written. Once you have your own owner files (where all of 
an owner's data resides in the same file), I encourage you to use 
one of yours.
